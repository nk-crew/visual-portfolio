Modern gallery and portfolio plugin with advanced layouts editor. Clean and powerful gallery styles with enormous settings in the Gutenberg block.

## Description ##

Create beautiful, clean, and powerful photo galleries and portfolio layouts using the Visual Portfolio plugin. It is easy for simple photo galleries, but powerful enough for professionals. Whether you're a photographer, agency, or anything in between, Visual Portfolio will boost your online presence.

We tried to make for you a convenient visual block editor for your gallery, portfolio, or any custom post type with support to various layouts such as Masonry, Justified, Tiles, Grid, and Carousel.

### Visual Gallery Builder ###

Build your portfolio and galleries with no coding knowledge. Thanks to Gutenberg page builder you are able to create and customize galleries visually.

### Optimized to be Fast as Native ###

Despite the rich functionality, the Visual Portfolio is optimized as much as possible, to be fast and lightweight.

All scripts and styles are loaded only when they are needed for the current page that displays your gallery. Pictures are not loaded in the main thread due to lazy loading. Moreover, our plugin is compatible with third-party WebP providers and image optimization plugins.

Smart adaptive image sizes fully supported.

### Layouts ###

Our gallery plugin shipped with popular layouts such as Masonry and Justified (Flickr). Every feature optimized and works seamlessly with all of these layouts, you just need to set up and go with no headache. See it in action:

### Easily Customizable ###

The gallery block with live preview includes a lot of design settings that are point-and-click, no coding knowledge required. If you're a bit more adventurous, the custom CSS module and PHP filters are set up to be easily used by developers.

### Portfolio Post Type ###

Custom post type `portfolio` will ensure all your portfolios to keep in a single post type. In this way, you can distinguish your portfolios from other post types. Taxonomies are used to categorize your portfolio types, it will help you to group and sort your portfolios.

### Photo Galleries ###

You can also create galleries using image sets right inside block editor. Just drop your images and gallery is ready.

### Powerful Lightbox ###

Visual Portfolio uses only modern solutions, and lightboxes are not an exception. High performance, mobile optimization, retina-ready, and a wide range of features available in Fancybox and PhotoSwipe plugins, that you can choose for your gallery lightboxes.

**Mobile Optimized** <br> Looks great on every device. Swipe to navigate, spread/pinch to zoom in/out supported on touch devices.

**GPU Accelerated** <br> Hardware accelerated animations for better performance and seamless user experience.

**Smart Loading** <br> Images are responsive and loaded progressively using lazy loading on demand.

## Installation ##

### Automatic installation ###

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Visual Portfolio, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Visual Portfolio” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual installation ###

The manual installation method involves downloading our Visual Portfolio plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

! IMPORTANT for version 2.x - this is a major plugin upgrade. A lot of things were changed. We recommend you test it on a staging site first before update it on the production site.

Migration Notes:

* If you extended portfolio options using PHP, you will need to remove `vp_` prefix from your custom options. Example - <https://github.com/nk-o/visual-portfolio/blob/master/src/classes/class-admin.php#L854-L865>
* If you overwrite templates and styles, you will need to change your styles to work with CSS variables (at least variables for overlay colors) - <https://visualportfolio.co/documentation/developers/css-variables/>
* If you overwrite templates with meta, you may see no icons displayed. Icons output changed and now it works like this - <https://github.com/nk-o/visual-portfolio/blob/master/src/templates/items-list/items-style/fade/meta.php#L55-L68>
